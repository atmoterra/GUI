# GRAL Dispersion Model<br>
This is a powerful graphical user interface (GUI). This application is designed to simplify the numerous GRAL or GRAMM input values, analyze and display results as contour lines, visualize wind vectors, and verify the input and output of the GRAL and GRAMM model. It is also possible to visualize the meteorological input data (wind roses, stability or velocity classes, diurnal frequencies of wind directions, diurnal mean wind velocity).<br>
There is a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfEVl-j4P5s) tutorial that shows and explains some basic functions of the GUI.<br>

## Built With
Windows [Visual Studio 2017 or higher](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) <br>
Linux  [MonoDevelop](https://www.monodevelop.com/) <br>

<br>

Compiling the GUI on Linux require NetCore 3.1. To install NetCore 3.1 on Ubuntu 20 LTS :
``` 
    wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.10/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
    sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
    sudo apt-get update 
    sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-3.1
    sudo apt install mono-runtime
    dotnet â€“info
``` 
<br>
Compiling the GUI on Linux require MonoDevelop. To install MonoDevelop on Ubuntu 20 LTS :

    sudo apt install apt-transport-https dirmngr
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF
    echo "deb https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu vs-bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-official-vs.list
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mono-complete
    sudo apt install monodevelop


When building the GUI in Linux, the following manual changes are needed:
* Disable compilation (set compilation to "None") for the WPF forms in the subfolder GRAL3DFunctions: X_3D_Win.xaml, X_3D_MeshExtensions.cs and X_3D_Win.xaml.cs. Click on the file with the right mouse button and select "None".
* Changes in the file "Domain.Designer.cs", located in the subfolder "GRALDomain": move the item "menustrip1" behind the item "GRAMMWindFieldsToolStripMenuItem"; otherwise the MenuItem.Check property is not working (seems to be a Mono Winforms bug)
* Conditional compilation for Mono is performed with the preprocessor directive `#if __MonoCS__`. Before compiling for Linux the symbol `__MonoCS__`must be defined in the compilation tab of MonoDevelop.
